# 🚲 NYC Bikeshare Analysis – Python

An exploratory data analysis and hypothesis testing project on NYC Citi Bike data to unlock user trends, optimize marketing, and inform operations.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Despite growth, Citi Bike’s user behavior and demand trends remain unclear—limiting targeted marketing and operational improvements.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze bikeshare trip data to **identify demographic patterns, usage trends, and station demand** to grow ridership and revenue.

---

## 🗂️ Dataset Overview

- Citi Bike trip data (2015–2017):  
  - Start/end times, stations, user demographics, trip duration

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing

- Cleaned, imputed missing values, removed anomalies
- Engineered features: day, month, hour, subscriber/customer segment

---

## 🧠 Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

- EDA: demographics, ride frequency, station popularity, timing
- Tested for duration differences by gender, customer type (t-tests)

---

## 📈 Results

- **Subscribers** dominate trips; weekday rush hours are peak
- Top stations identified for ad/operational focus
- **No significant gender difference** in trip duration
- Casual customers take longer rides than subscribers

---

## 🧪 Libraries Used

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- `scipy`, `scikit-learn`

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Data-driven insights enable targeted marketing (e.g., female riders, weekends)
- Peak hour analysis informs fleet distribution and ad placement
- Short trips/commutes dominate NYC bikeshare usage

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Integrate weather and event data for deeper demand modeling
- Deploy real-time station demand dashboards
- Develop churn prediction for subscribers
